# Open Side Bar and Focus File

This [Sublime Text 3][1] plugin will open the side bar and focus on the current file (if there is one)
when you run the command "Open Side Bar And Focus File".

It's a simplified version of [Focus File on Sidebar][2], so you should probably use that.



## Installing

You can `git clone git@github.com:akrabat/OpenSideBarAndFocusFile.git` from within your `Packages` folder.

## Keyboard shortcut

There are no default keybindings, so you can add your own.

I use:

    {"keys": ["super+shift+1"], "command": "open_sidebar_and_focus_file"},
